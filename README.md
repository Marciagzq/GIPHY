# GIPHY

The code in this folder is an assignment for UCF bootcamp. 

On this code, we were challenged to use APIs and call certain information defined by parameters,
This web application will allow the user to get some gifs and certain details of itself with it.
The user also may be able to add some new buttons with the animal, which is going to define the search with every click.
If you click a different button (animal), the gifs section will remove the previous search and it will show the new information. 

If any suggestion, do not hesitate to contact me on my personal email: marcia.gzq@gmail.com
I would appreciate any comment, I know it may be very beneficial on my proffesional growth.
